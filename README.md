# [Get Started With Augmented Reality for iOS][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus MÃ¼hlberger][instructor url]

Augmented reality is an up-and-coming technology for mobile apps, popularized by the hit game Pokemon Go. With the recent enhancements to Android and iOS it is now easier than ever to begin developing AR applications. 

In this course you will learn to code augmented reality apps for iOS using the ARKit framework. You'll learn how to detect flat surfaces in the real world, how to add geometric primitives and models to the AR scene, how to light your scene in a way that matches the ambient conditions, and even how to appply physics to your AR models. As if that's not enough, you'll also learn how to create an AR measurement app, to measure the distance between any two points in the real world!
